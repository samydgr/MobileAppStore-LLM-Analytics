# MobileAppStore-LLM-Analytics

## Overview

**MobileAppStore-LLM-Analytics** is a powerful tool for extracting insights and performing analytics on mobile app store data using Large Language Models (LLMs). The project fine-tunes **BERT** for classifying whether an app is successful or not and leverages **Gemma-2-9B**, a more powerful LLM, to explain the reasons for failure.

## Features

- üìä **Data Filtering & Exploration**: Users can filter and explore mobile app data by genre, price, size, currency, and user rating.
- ü§ñ **LLM-Based Analysis**: Uses a chatbot to analyze app descriptions and provide insights into user engagement.
- üìà **App Success Prediction**: Fine-tunes BERT to classify whether an app is likely to be successful.
- üìâ **Failure Explanation**: Uses **Gemma-2-9B** to analyze and explain why an app might fail or success.
- üèó **Streamlit UI**: Provides an interactive web-based dashboard for seamless user experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

## Model Details

### Fine-Tuned BERT for Classification

- Tokenizer: `BertTokenizer`
- Model: `BertForSequenceClassification`
- Training: Fine-tuned on app store data to classify app success.

### Gemma-2-9B for Failure Explanation

- Provides insights into why an app might fail based on metadata and user feedback.
- Analyzes user sentiment and suggests improvements.

## Dataset

The project uses Apple App Store datasets:

- `AppleStore.csv`: Contains metadata about apps.
- `appleStore_description.csv`: Contains app descriptions.
